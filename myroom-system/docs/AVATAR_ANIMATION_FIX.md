# Avatar Animation Synchronization Fix

## 🐛 Problem Description

When changing avatar parts (hair, clothing, accessories, etc.) to new parts, the new parts were not properly synchronized with the existing animations. This resulted in:

- **Animation Desync**: New parts would appear static while other parts continued animating
- **No Skeleton Assignment**: New parts didn't get the proper skeleton assignment from the body
- **Missing Animation Cloning**: New parts didn't receive cloned animations from existing parts
- **Frame Mismatch**: New parts started from frame 0 instead of syncing with current animation frame

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `useAvatarLoader.ts` file. The code had proper animation synchronization logic for **gender changes** but was missing the same logic for **regular part changes**.

### Code Comparison:

**Gender Change Section (Working):**
```typescript
// Lines 295-365 in useAvatarLoader.ts
// --- BẮT ĐẦU: Áp dụng animation hiện tại cho part mới ---
// 1. Gán skeleton body cho mesh mới nếu chưa có skeleton
// 2. Clone animation hiện tại cho part mới
// 3. Sync frame/time với animation chính
// --- KẾT THÚC: Áp dụng animation hiện tại cho part mới ---
```

**Regular Part Change Section (Broken):**
```typescript
// Lines 412-470 in useAvatarLoader.ts
// Missing animation synchronization code!
partResult.meshes.forEach(mesh => {
  // Only basic setup, no animation sync
});
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Animation Synchronization to Regular Part Changes

**File:** `src/shared/components/babylon/useAvatarLoader.ts`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Skeleton Assignment**: Assign body skeleton to new parts
2. **Animation Cloning**: Clone existing idle/walk animations for new parts
3. **Frame Synchronization**: Sync animation frame with currently playing animations
4. **Animation Array Management**: Add cloned animations to appropriate arrays

### 2. Added Animation Cleanup

**Changes Made:**

1. **Part Replacement Cleanup**: Clean up animations when parts are replaced
2. **Complete Part Removal**: Clean up animations when parts are completely removed
3. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper disposal of old animations

### 3. Added Debug Logging

**Changes Made:**

1. **Skeleton Assignment Logging**: Log when skeletons are assigned to new parts
2. **Animation Cloning Logging**: Log successful animation cloning
3. **Frame Sync Logging**: Log frame synchronization
4. **Cleanup Logging**: Log animation cleanup operations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Animation Synchronization Process

1. **Load New Part**: Import new avatar part mesh
2. **Assign Skeleton**: Get skeleton from body part and assign to new part
3. **Clone Animations**: Clone existing idle and walk animations
4. **Map Bones**: Use `findMappedBone` function to map animation bones to skeleton
5. **Sync Frame**: Get current frame from playing animation and sync new part
6. **Add to Arrays**: Add cloned animations to `allIdleAnimationsRef` and `allWalkAnimationsRef`

### Key Functions Added

```typescript
// Skeleton assignment
partResult.meshes.forEach(mesh => {
  if (!mesh.skeleton && mainSkeleton) {
    mesh.skeleton = mainSkeleton;
  }
});

// Animation cloning with bone mapping
const clonedAnim = animGroup.clone(`${animGroup.name}_${partType}_new_${meshIdx}`, (oldTarget: any) => {
  if (oldTarget.name && mesh.skeleton && mesh.skeleton.bones) {
    const mappedBone = findMappedBone(oldTarget.name, mesh.skeleton);
    if (mappedBone) {
      return mappedBone.getTransformNode() || mappedBone;
    }
  }
  return null;
});

// Frame synchronization
if (clonedAnim.animatables && clonedAnim.animatables.length > 0) {
  clonedAnim.animatables.forEach((animatable: any) => {
    if (typeof animatable.goToFrame === 'function') {
      animatable.goToFrame(currentFrame);
    }
  });
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test File Created
- **File:** `avatar-animation-test.html`
- **Purpose:** Guide for testing avatar animation synchronization
- **Instructions:** Step-by-step manual testing process

### Test Steps
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open application in browser
3. Navigate to Integrated Mode
4. Change avatar parts using controls
5. Verify new parts immediately sync with animations
6. Test avatar movement to ensure all parts animate together

### Expected Results
- ✅ New parts immediately sync with existing animations
- ✅ No animation desync or lag
- ✅ All parts move together during avatar movement
- ✅ Console logs show successful animation synchronization

## 📝 Console Logs

The fix includes comprehensive logging to help with debugging:

```
🦴 Assigned skeleton to new hair part: hair_mesh_001
🎭 Applying idle animation to new hair part
✅ Cloned idle animation for hair part 0: breathing_idle_hair_new_0
🔄 Synced idle animation frame 45 for hair part
🎯 Animation synchronization completed for new hair part
🧹 Cleaning up 2 animations for old hair part
🗑️ Cleaned up animation: breathing_idle_hair_old_0
```

## 🚀 Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ New avatar parts appeared static
- ❌ Animation desync between parts
- ❌ Poor user experience when changing parts
- ❌ Potential memory leaks from uncleaned animations

### After Fix
- ✅ New parts immediately sync with animations
- ✅ Smooth animation transitions
- ✅ Consistent user experience
- ✅ Proper memory management
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging support
